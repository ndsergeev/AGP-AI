## Overview
This project was developed over the course of a semester, through 3 assignments. These assignments focused around the development of AI, Procedural Generation, then finally Multiplayer and general polish. For our first two assessments, we also had to produce videos documenting our work.

## AI Assignment
In our AI assignment, we created a sound notification system for our enemies to be able to hear the player and their interactions in the world.

## Procedural Generation Assignment
For our Procedural Generation assignment, we created a level generation system that used a [Binary Space Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning) algorithm to create rooms joined by corridors.

## Multiplayer and Polish Assignment
Finally we added Multiplayer, inspired by Left 4 Dead, where players spawn together and must reach a 'flag' objective to win. We also polished our level generation system, adding procedurally placed lamps and improving textures.
